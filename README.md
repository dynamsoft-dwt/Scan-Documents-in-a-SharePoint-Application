#### Instructions

In order to run the sample, you need to

1. Install Dynamic Web TWAIN on a PC running Windows
2. The /Resources/ folder and all the files inside are the files required on the server side for Dynamic Web TWAIN. 
Weâ€™ll upload them to the SharePoint layouts folder so that they can be accessed through the SharePoint server. 
Find your SharePoint LAYOUTS folder. Typically, this is located at: 
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Web Server Extensions\15\TEMPLATE\LAYOUTS
Copy the previously mentioned /Resources/ folder and all the files here.
3. In the file dynamsoft.webtwain.config, change the following line like this

Dynamsoft.WebTwainEnv.ResourcesPath = '_layouts/Resources';

4. Attach the web part in the sample to your sharepoint application
